# Monte Carlo Simulation of the 2D Ising Model

This is a simple Python implementation of the 2D Ising model using the Metropolis Monte Carlo method. It simulates the behavior of a grid of binary spins under local interaction rules and tracks the system's energy over time.

## Overview

The Ising model is a mathematical model used in statistical mechanics to describe ferromagnetism. Spins are placed on a lattice and interact with their nearest neighbors. The goal is to understand how local interactions lead to global behavior such as phase transitions and magnetization.

In this simulation:
- Spins take values of 0 or 1
- Each spin interacts with its four nearest neighbors
- Periodic boundary conditions are applied
- The Metropolis algorithm is used to accept or reject spin flips

## Features

- Randomly initialized square spin matrix
- Local energy computation using coupling constant `J`
- Energy updates using the Metropolis criterion
- Periodic boundary conditions
- Prints total energy at regular intervals

## How to Run

Run the script using Python 3:

```bash
python ising_model.py
````

You will be prompted to enter:

* `length`: the size of the square spin matrix (e.g., 10)
* `steps`: the number of simulation steps to perform (e.g., 500)
* `J`: the coupling constant (positive for ferromagnetic interaction)

Example input:

```
Enter the length of the array: 10
Enter the number of steps: 500
Enter the value for J: 1
```

## Sample Output

```
Initial total energy: -24
Total energy after step 50: -40
Total energy after step 100: -46
...
Final total energy: -60
```

## Requirements

This script uses only Python standard libraries:

* `random`
* `math`

No installation of external packages is required.

## Possible Extensions

* Replace 0/1 spins with -1/+1 for a more conventional model
* Add temperature and simulate thermal fluctuations
* Plot energy vs. steps using `matplotlib`
* Track magnetization over time
* Visualize the spin lattice dynamically
